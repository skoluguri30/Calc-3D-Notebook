## Dot Products and Cross Products

| Dot Products | Cross Products |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3 = |a||b|\cos{\theta}$ | a vector, pseudo-determinant, $|a||b|\sin{\theta}$ |
| projection | area of parallelogram, orthogonal to the two vectors |
| dot product is 0: perpendicular | cross product is zero: parallel |

> The volume of a parallelepiped is given by $\vec{c}\cdot(\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$.
